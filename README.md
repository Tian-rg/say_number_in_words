# say_number_in_words
This is a coding practice, trying to say number in different language.

The number can be said in the language the client chooses. Currently, it supports 3 languages: Chinese, English and Indonesian.

This repository is intended for coding practice. 

I have been learning the Python programming languages for one year and a half, with the purpose to get the skills in data analysis, and web development. In future, I want to further my exploration into cloud computing and machine learning.
